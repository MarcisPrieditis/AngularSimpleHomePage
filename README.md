# Angule Github Project Showcase

After little crash course about angular, decided to make my own simple showcase style web page on Angular to understand little bit better angular. <br/>
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.3.

How to run:<br/>
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
